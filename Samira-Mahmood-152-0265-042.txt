Tasks:
1. Collected Mango images from google and labeled them using labelImg for the training process.Mango folder images inside object_detection/images/mango.
2. Added the mango_labelmap.pbtxt in object_detector/training.
3. Train the Mango object. Trained it for 23 hours.
4. Created the Object_detection_mango_image.py which is used to run and test the mango object detector using the test_mango.jpg inside object_detection folder.
5. After the training process completed generated the frozen_inference_graph.pb file which is inside the object_detection/inference_graph
6.Created another python script the Object_detection_mango_video.py which is used to run and detect the mango object using the test_mango.mp4 inside the
  object_detection folder.
7. Update or make changes to the README.md file and also in wrote the description.
8. Added Dockerfile to create a object detection docker image.
9.Edited the python file Object_detection_mango_image.py to implement the Fruits.db and now image mango shows information.
10.Added commenting in Object_detection_mango_image.py and Object_detection_mango_video.py to help understand.



Could you complete? What were the challenges?
Yes was able to complete the task of classifying my assigned image Mango.It can detect the mango image in a picture with many other objects and also in different 
backgrounds.It was very difficult in the sense that from the beginning there were a lot of version incompatibiilty issues.As well as not having a computer with
GPU, had to use tensorflow CPU version because of which the training process took longer around 23 hours.
