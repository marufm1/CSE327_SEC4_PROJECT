Tasks:
1. Collected Mango images from google and labeled them using labelImg for the training process.Mango folder images inside object_detection/images/mango.
2. Added the mango_labelmap.pbtxt in object_detector/training.
3. Train the Mango object. Trained it for 23 hours.
4. Created the Object_detection_mango_image.py which is used to run and test the mango object detector using the test_mango.jpg inside object_detection folder.
5. After the training process completed generated the frozen_inference_graph.pb file which is inside the object_detection/inference_graph
6. Update or make changes to the README.md file and also in wrote the description.
7. Make fixes to code if necessary.

Could you complete? What were the challenges?
Yes was able to complete the task of classifying my assigned image Mango.It can detect the mango image in a picture with many other objects and also in different 
backgrounds.It was very difficult in the sense that from the beginning there were a lot of version incompatibiilty issues.As well as not having a computer with
GPU, had to use tensorflow CPU version because of which the training process took longer around 23 hours.
