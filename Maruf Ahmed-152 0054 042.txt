Tasks:
1. Training process of the Banana object. Trained it for 16 hours.
2. Added the frozen_inference_graph_banana.pb in iference_graph folder
3. Added the banana_labelmap.pbtxt file in training folder
4. Tested and ran the object detector by making a Object_detection_banana_image.py
5. Added changes to the README.md file and wrote the instructions for running the program.
6. Fixed errors and bugs to make the program run properly.
7. Will try to add more functionalities.
8. banana folder also uploaded in images
9. Added the Requirement.txt file for Docker.
10. Helped with the Dockerfile
11. Also previously added the Object_detection_webcam_banana.py file which can detect Banana object using the webcam of a computer.



Difficulties faced:
1. All the installation procedures were very difficult due to having version mismatch and more problems
2. The training process showed errors due to some version problems
3. The training process takes a lot of time (approximately 20 hours)
4. Learning everything about tensorflow took all of us a huge amount of time as we are all unfamiliar with the things
5. There wasn't a proper guideline in the internet that would help us go through all the processes without any errors

Overcoming the difficulties:
We managed to solve all the problems mentioned above but we did take a very long time in understanding every thing to make
this possible. We didn't even have access to a very good machine which could help with the training process and also save
us some time as the Tensorflow Training process takes a huge amount of time as mentioned before. Using the GPU version which
needs a very good GPU would have made the process faster but was we didn't have access to a good GPU we had to train using 
CPU and we made things possible.
